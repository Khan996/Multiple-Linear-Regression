# Multiple-Linear-Regression
**1. Linear Regression model is applied on multiple features.**

**2. For MLinear_Reg.ipynb, advertisisng.csv is used. Whereas, for the other notebook, ML_reg_mk_reg_data.ipynb, data is generated via make_regression from scikit learn.** 

**3. In Mul_LR_class.ipynb, multiple Linear Regression model is coded from scratch to build the model. This model works on any number of dimensions.**
